                   Summary
                </h2>
                <p>The Hunger Games is a dystopian novel that takes place in futuristic North America, in a country known as Panem. Panem is separated into 12 districts, impoverished and each having an established industry, and the Capitol, whose inhabitants live in luxury.</p> 
                <p> As tribute for inciting rebellion many years before, each district must surrender 2 randomly chosen children, one boy and one girl, between the ages of 12-18 for an annual event known as the Hunger Games, a brutal tournament where the 24 tributes must fight to the death.</p>
                <p>Katniss Everdeen lives in 12, the coal mining district. After her father is killed in a mining accident, Katniss struggles to keep her family alive, having to enter her name into the choosing more times for food, and illegally hunting in the woods.
                    When the day arrives one year, her younger sister, Prim, is chosen against all odds. Katniss volunteers to go instead, and is taken to the games along with a boy, Peeta Mellark.</p>
                <p>Once in the arena, she has to fight the other tributes, the elements, and even the arena itself to survive. She eventually allies with Rue, a tribute from 11, who is brutally killed in the following days. After Rue’s death, there is an announcement that changes the rules so that 2 tributes from the same district can win instead of only one, which causes Katniss to search for Peeta.</p>    
                <p>She finds him badly wounded and has to nurse him to health. They fake falling in love (and kinda do) to gain sponsors, who give helpful items to keep them alive. During that time, an announcement is made that useful supplies for the remaining tributes have been laid at the cornucopia in the center, and Katniss leaves to get medicine for Peeta.  She gets in a fight, where she is spared by Thresh, the other tribute from 11, for allying with Rue.</p>
                <p>With Peeta having recovered, the two of them leave towards the center, waiting for an eventual fight with Cato, the only other remaining tribute. They find him at the center, running from Muttations, superintelligent genetically modified creations of the Capitol. They have a heated encounter atop the cornucopia that ends in Cato’s slow and painful death.</p>   
                <p>After this, a new announcement is made revoking the previous change, so once again only one tribute can remain. Katniss and Peeta refuse to kill each other, so either in defiance or in love, they bring out poisonous berries to kill themselves and leave the Games without a victor, but before they do, a frantic announcement is called to stop them and abruptly give them a victory, removing them from the arena. The book ends as the celebrations happen.
                </p> <p>Overall the author wrote this book very well. The character development is amazing, and I couldn’t put the book down. I rate this book <bold>4.7/5 Gavin Points.</bold>
